            <p>Cnet gives us a great example. On the top of the page it shows the main story. Next, it shows all the subtittles which are aligned to the left of the page with the same font and size.
                On the right side of the page, the images are based on the news stories, again with the same proportion and size.
                This way Cnet makes their page easy to follow the stories and the relationship between them.</p>

            <p>Esty is a good example of the principle of proximity. They use the distance to show which parts are important. Each title is next to the picture that it is describing, and also has the category above it which is very helpful. At the top and bottom of the viewport, there are menus to help with navegational links, all grouped together to show their relationship.</p>

    <section> <h2>WHITE SPACE AND CLEAN DESIGN</h2>
        <h3>The Church of Jesus Christ</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng"> Church website</a>
        </p>
            <img src="images/church.jpg" alt="lds website">
            <p>I think the Church has come along ways with their website. One of the last updates the website look clean and does not compete with the information provided. For example, on the top it shows the name of the church in the center with 
            a white background. Next, it show the stories from biggest to smallest, starting with larger images and stories at the top, and smaller ones as you scroll down, and all the extra infromation for those headlines are hidden within the icon.
