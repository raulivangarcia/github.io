        <h3>Cnet</h3>

            <p>Cnet gives us a great example. On the top of the page it shows the main story. Next, it shows all the subtittles which are aligned to the left of the page with the same font and size.
                On the right side of the page, the images are based on the news stories, again with the same proportion and size.
                This way Cnet makes their page easy to follow the stories and the relationship between them.</p>

        <h2>RULE OF THIRDS</h2>
        <h3>Etsy</h3>

            <p>Esty is very clever with the way they use the rule of thirds on their mobile device site. The viewport 
                is divided into thirds, displaying three pictures on the left size with the same distance around each picture. 
                On the right side, they have the titles and subtitles in line with the pictures.</p>

    <section> <h2>WHITE SPACE AND CLEAN DESIGN</h2>
        <h3>The Church of Jesus Christ</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuscrhist.org"> Church website</a>
        </p>
            <img src="images/church.jpg" alt="lds website">
            <p>I think the Church has come along ways with their website. One of the last updates the website look clean and does not compete with the information provided. For example, on the top it shows the name of the church in the center with 
            a white background. Next, it show the stories from biggest to smallest, starting with larger images and stories at the top, and smaller ones as you scroll down, and all the extra infromation for those headlines are hidden within the icon.
