He needs to pay attention to the weather in order to take care of his crops, knowing when to plant and harvest, when to water more, and when to be careful of frost. He works hard, especially in the summer, but he makes time for community events and festivals.</p>

        <p> Heidi Smith is a 45 year old woman who lives in Fish Haven, Idaho. She has a family business that rents and sells recreational equipment. Her shop is on the edge of Bear Lake, and she likes to check the weather to try and predict how well her business will do.
